A little creative coding project I made for the raspberry pi.

Getting screen capture on the pi was clearly beyond me so here is a handheld video of it running on the pi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWJTcYbwZoM

Put it on your PI, install [pi3d](https://github.com/pi3d/pi3d.github.com) then run

```
python start.py
```
